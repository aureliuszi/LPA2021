    "This jupyter notebook will help you prepare the Pilgrim Bank (A) case for class discussion. Jupyter notebooks are useful for combining normal text with R code and output (or other types of code, such as Python). For example, you can use Jupyter Notebooks when creating reports that contain analyses, or when describing and documenting your analyses so others can understand what you've done."

    "The text you're reading now is in a **markdown cell**. Markdown cells contain human language text and allow you to intersperse your R code with written commentary. To create a new markdown cell, go to the menu above, click the \"+\" button, and then use the nearby dropdown menu to switch from \"Code\" to \"Markdown\". After entering text in a markdown cell, you can click the \"Run\" button above to make your text appear nicely formatted and easy to read, just like this cell you're reading now.         \n",
    "\n",
    "Below you'll also see slightly shaded cells with \"In[ ]\" to the left of them. These are **code cells**. The \"In[ ]\" before a code cell tells you this is code input. When you run a code cell, the code's corresponding output will appear directly below your code. You can run a cell by pressing the \"Run\" button in the menu above or by hitting \"Shift + Enter\" (Mac) or \"Ctrl + Enter\" (PC). You can edit and run the code in a code cell as many times as you'd like, and the new output will simply replace the previous output below the code. This feature allows you to try different commands, models, or other analyses and immediately see the output as you go. To add a new code cell, select the \"+\" button above, which by default adds a code cell. "
