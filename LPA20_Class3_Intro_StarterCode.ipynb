        "### Purpose:     \n",
        "The goal of this notebook is to provide students with R code to help them learn some basic functionality when running R in a jupyter notebook. Jupyter notebooks are useful for combining normal text with R code and output (or other types of code, such as Python). For example, you can use jupyter notebooks when creating reports that contain analyses, or when describing and documenting your analyses so others can understand what you've done.\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook demonstrates how to use R using a simplified version of data from the Pilgrim Bank (A) case. We will use the full version of the data from this case in tomorrow's class (Class 4).    \n",
        "\n",
        "The Pilgrim Bank (A) case contains data about bank customers, with each row of data representing an individual customer. The dataset used in the current notebook contains only two variables for a subset of Pilgrim Bank customers. These two variables are: \n",
        "* profit99: Annual Profit in 1999 for each customer in dollars\n",
        "* tenure99: The number of years each individual has been a customer of Pilgrim Bank\n",
        "\n",
        "### Jupyter Notebooks:\n",
        "Jupyter Notebooks are organized into **cells**. There are two primary cell types in Jupyter: **code cells** and **markdown cells**.      \n",
        "\n",
        "The text you're reading now is in a **markdown cell**. Markdown cells contain human language text and allow you to intersperse your R code with written commentary. To create a new markdown cell, go to the menu above, click the \"+\" button, and then use the nearby dropdown menu to switch from \"Code\" to \"Markdown\". After entering text in a markdown cell, you can click the \"Run\" button above to make your text appear nicely formatted and easy to read, just like this cell you're reading now.         \n",
        "\n",
        "Below you'll also see slightly shaded cells with \"In[ ]\" to the left of them. These are **code cells**. The \"In[ ]\" before a code cell tells you this is code input. When you run a code cell, the code's corresponding output will appear directly below your code. You can run a cell by putting your cursor in the code cell and then clicking the \"Run\" button in the menu above (or by hitting \"Shift + Enter\" (Mac) or \"Ctrl + Enter\" (PC)). You can edit and run the code in a code cell as many times as you'd like, and the new output will simply replace the previous output below the code. This feature allows you to try different commands, models, or other analyses and immediately see the output as you go. To add a new code cell, select the \"+\" button above, which by default adds a code cell wherever the cursor is in the notebook. \n",
        "\n",
        "You can insert a new cell on any line using any of three methods:\n",
        "\n",
        "* by clicking \"+\" in the menu above\n",
        "* by clicking the Insert option in the menu above\n",
        "* by using the keyboard shortcut \"Esc + A\" or \"Esc + B\" to insert a cell above or below respectively\n",
        "\n",
        "If you're interested in learning more about using jupyter notebook shortcuts, click \"Help\" in the menu above and navigate to \"Keyboard Shortcuts\". For additional information, here is a great resource: https://towardsdatascience.com/jypyter-notebook-shortcuts-bf0101a98330\n",
